# Getting Started

Welcome to our guide for learning algorithms and data structures with TypeScript!

In this guide, we'll walk you through the basics of TypeScript and how to get your development environment set up so you can start coding right away.

If you're new to TypeScript, don't worry! We'll provide explanations and examples every step of the way to help you understand the fundamentals.

Let's dive in and start our journey into the world of algorithms and data structures!

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
  - After installation, ensure that the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` are functioning in your terminal (you may need to restart your system for these to work).

- Any code editor or IDE of your choice. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but here are some other popular options:
  - [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)
  - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
  - [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
