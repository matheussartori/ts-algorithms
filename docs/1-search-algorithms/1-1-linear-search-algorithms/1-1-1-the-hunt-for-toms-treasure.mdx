# 1. The Hunt for Tom's treasure

In a treasure hunt game, your friend Tom hid his treasure behind trees with a certain number of branches. Given an
array representing the number of branches of each tree, find the index of the tree with the specified number of
branches.

If the specified number of branches is not found, return -1.

```typescript
const treeBranches = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
const targetBranches = 6
findTreasureIndex(treeBranches, targetBranches) // Expected Output: Index of tree with 6 branches (2)
```

<Editor initialCode={`function findTreasureIndex (treeBranches: number[], targetBranches: number): number {
  return -1;
}`} />
